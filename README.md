### Can I fork, steel code, white label it, etc?
Yes! Use this theme for whatever you want. If you do I would appreciate if you kept a reference to the original project so other people can find it. Also if you create anything cool consider oppening it as PR here or at the least sharing it so others can benifet. With that said you do not have to.
